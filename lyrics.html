        <pre>
            Yeah, don't play with me, I'm on some other shit, like
            Some whole other shit, like
            (Star made the beat, I just took it out the oven)
            Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
            It's just me and my cup in this bitch
            DRKSHDW all on my Rick
            VVS all on my wrist
            I bought an Uzi today, and it's already hot, it ain't come with a cooling kit
            She ain't fuck with me back then, but wanna fuck with me now, huh, I'm cool, lil' bitch
            Huh, let's go hit a lick
            Huh, let's go do a drill
            I heard he got a mill' in his crib, and he stay up in the hills (8-808)
            We don't give a fuck who you is, we don't give a fuck how you feel
            We don't give a fuck how you feel, we don't give no fucks
            I copped a Mercedes, I ditched that AMG, I'm ridin' the G-Wagon Truck
            I just might go buy the SVJ, 'cause I like how the doors go up
            My boy, he be catchin' them bodies, he catchin' them bodies, I'm watching the scores go up
            Yo' gang probably caught a few bodies, but I ain't worried about it, 'cause we droppin' more than them
            Step on shit like Timbs, pull up with a FN Five-seveN, that bih' take off limbs
            I just popped a private jet, G6, I'm 'bout to take off, yeah
            They like, "Hold up, hold up, hold up, you boutta take off right here"
            I'm 'boutta take off, yeah
            Niggas ain't fuckin' with me when it come to swag, huh, I'm passin' it out
            Shawty got no respect when it come to that ass, huh, she passin' it out
            I be VET-VET-VETEMENTS from head to toe, even the sock
            I got every Balenciaga boots, except for the Crocs
            Rick Owens all over my, Rick Owens all over me

            I pulled up to my show, rock out this bitch, then I leave
            I don't fuck with these niggas, like they got a disease

            I got that bitch in H&M, then now she rock double C
            I got that bitch named Gabriela and now she rocks double G
            I took my other bitch to Louis Vuitton and bought her everything, yeah-yeah
            If it's up then it's stuck, leave it in the air
            Missionary, her legs up, I got them in the air
            This bitch a freak, this bitch let me fuck her anywhere
            Shawty whip it out in front of my partner, she don't even care
            I'm elite with these hoes
            I'll put a bitch in her place, I'll tell that bitch where to go
            If I tell that lil' bitch to dance, she gon' tango
            If I tell her to paint me a picture, she gon' Van Gogh
            She insane with that throat, she insane wit' it
            I told her she insane, if she gon' let the gang hit
            I pass her to the gang, yeah, just like James, nigga
            I be killin' that pussy, be killin' that pussy feel like John Wayne, nigga
            He was talkin' that, huh, and all he heard was a bang, nigga

            Huh, let's go do a drill
            I heard he got a mill' in his crib, and he stay up in the hills (8-808)
            We don't give a fuck who you is, we don't give a fuck how you feel

            <dd>"Thank you ken so much. I had a disease in my ears, my family was suffering, and my dog had cancer. After hearing this majestic and gorgeous album all my diseases are cured and can even hear colors. I started my own company and am on track to soon have my pants falling from all these racks in my pockets. Thanks you again for your blessings and your potential to cure all my problems. I will never forget you and will always carry you in my heart till my last day comes. Thank you."</dd>

            <dd>"Where do I even begin to describe the life-altering impact that A Great Chaos by Ken Carson has had on me? This isn't just an album; it's a beacon of hope, a catalyst for change, and for me, a literal lifesaver.

                Before this album entered my life, I was grappling with drug addiction and was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The odds were stacked against me, and I had almost given up. But the raw emotion and powerful messages in tracks like Fighting My Demons and Hardcore resonated deeply within me. They gave me the strength to not only quit drugs but also to fight for my life. Miraculously, my latest medical reports show that I am cancer-free. While I can't scientifically prove it, I genuinely believe that the emotional healing triggered by this album played a role in my physical recovery.
                
                Beyond my health, this album has transformed my social and financial life. The confidence it instilled in me has been magnetic. I've been receiving a lot of positive attention, especially from women, and my social life has never been better.
                
                Financially, A Great Chaos has been a wake-up call. Inspired by Ken Carson's hustle and ambition, I've significantly increased my income, allowing me to live a life I once only dreamed of.
                
                In summary, A Great Chaos is more than just an album. It's been a transformative force that has fundamentally changed my life for the better in every conceivable way. Thank you, Ken Carson, for this unparalleled masterpiece.  #AGreatChaos #LifeChanging #MiracleAlbum."</dd>

Your music resonates with me on a deep level, connecting to my emotions in ways I never thought possible. Each track is a journey, taking me to places I've never been before. Your talent shines through every lyric, every beat, and I can't help but be inspired by your artistry. Your music has become the soundtrack to my life, and I am forever grateful for the impact it has had on me."</dd>
